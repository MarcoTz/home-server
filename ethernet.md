# Ethernet 

Currently, there is no reliable way to get ethernet from the router to the server, where it currently stands.
The router can't be moved, since it's at the only cable internet port of the house.

## Direct Cable

Option 1: Take a long ethernet cable and run it from the router to the server.

### Advantages 

* Direct connection
* No interferences
* cable housing already on the wall

### Disadvantages 

* Requires a very long ethernet cable, probably around 20m
* Probably needs to be discussed with our landlord


## Powerline ethernet 

Option 2: Use powerline ethernet adapters to get ethernet to the server.

### Advantages 

* Easy to set up 
* no additinal wires needed 

### Disadvantages 

* Unsure how godo the powerlines are 
* possible interference from especially the fridge 
* might be over a circuit breaker, which could interfere as well
* expensive adapters 

## Ethernet over Coax

Option 3: Use Coax to ethernet adapters to connect the server .

### Advantages 

* tv/radio over cable is not used, so probably no interference

### Disadvantages 

* Still requires an ethernet cable from the bedroom to the server, since there are no ports in the office
* expensive adapters
